Possible Improvements for PBPWScraper:

    - Using frequency analysis on discovered passwords to identify which characters are more common in passwords and
        weighing individual characters (would be slow) of filtered results to decrease the false-positive counts.

    - Automating the process on an interval (takes about 5 minutes for a new batch of public posts to be displayed
        in any sort of numbers) and generate an auto-reporting feature for the site.
